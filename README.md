To use this repo to create spectograms from sound files, you need to clone this repo to your computer.

Then it is wise to create a virtual environment to install the packages you need. 

To do this, run this code from the terminal after cloning:

```
python -m venv your-venv-name
```

Then install librosa, pandas and matplotlib:

```
pip install librosa, pandas, matplotlib
```

You also need to download your sound files and put them in the project folder. 

Once you have done these steps you are ready to create some mel spectograms!
